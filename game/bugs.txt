Bugs:

-------------
This happens only occasionally during map generation:

File "/home/xenoryt/projects/game/mapgenerator.py", line 248, in create
    if rooms[i].isOverlap(rooms[n]):
IndexError: list index out of range

-------------

The map generation seems to occasionally destroy the outer most walls.
This should never happen.

-------------

"Error: 64" ????
It creates a map with random holes everywhere

Possibly line 124 of world.py in dig()
print "Error: ",len(this.map)

Would explain holes since it does not finish digging all the holes.
This means it generated an area OUTSIDE the map.
May be related with BUG #2 where it outermost walls are destroyed.


-------------

There was one instance where not all rooms were connected (even though they should be)
I believe I have fixed this, but not 100% sure.
